# The Dracula Story of The Philosopher's Stone

Count Dracula crept silently through the halls of Hogwarts, his eyes peeled for any sign of the legendary Philosopher's Stone. Word had reached him of its powerful properties, and he knew he had to have it for himself.

He searched high and low, hiding in the shadows as he hunted for clues. But as he prowled through the castle, he began to notice something peculiar. Everywhere he went, he saw signs of the young wizard, Harry Potter.

Dracula followed the trail of Harry's footsteps through the castle, stalking him as he snuck around corners and slipped through secret passageways. But he couldn't understand what the boy was doing. It seemed as though he was trying to stop Dracula from getting his hands on the Philosopher's Stone.

As Dracula drew closer to the stone, Harry appeared before him, wand at the ready. Dracula reached for the stone, but Harry cast a spell, causing it to vanish from sight.

"I won't let you have it," Harry said, determinedly, "the stone must stay here at Hogwarts, where it's safe."

Dracula bared his fangs, ready to attack Harry, but the young wizard was ready. He cast a spell, and a bright light filled the room. Before Dracula could react, he was tackled by a group of trained wizards from the school's faculty.

"Good work, Harry," said Professor Dumbledore, appearing in the doorway. "Thanks to you, we've foiled Dracula's plans once again."

Harry beamed with pride, knowing that he had helped save the Philosopher's Stone from falling into the wrong hands. He had learned an important lesson that day, that sometimes the greatest heroism lies in standing up to those who seek to do harm, even when it may seem impossible to win. 

# Resolution

Through Harry's bravery, we can learn that it is important to protect what is precious, even when faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The plot of The Philosopher's Stone teaches us valuable lessons about the power of friendship, the importance of loyalty, and the courage it takes to stand up to evil forces. It is through these themes that we can see how the story of Harry Potter has captured the hearts and imaginations of readers around the world, and why it continues to be a beloved classic more than two decades after its publication. By following Harry's example, we can all strive to be brave, loyal, and true to our convictions, no matter what challenges we may face.
The code used to resolve the Dracula story involves The Levitation Charm, a spell in the Harry Potter universe that allows the user to levitate objects. In this story, Harry uses the Levitation Charm to make the Philosopher's Stone disappear from sight, preventing Dracula from obtaining it.

The code to cast the Levitation Charm in Python is:

```
# Define the function that will execute the Levitation Charm
def levitation_charm(object):
    print(object, "is now under the effect of the Levitation Charm!")

# Cast the Levitation Charm on the Philosopher's Stone
philosophers_stone = "Philosopher's Stone"
levitation_charm(philosophers_stone)
```

This code will print the message, "Philosopher's Stone is now under the effect of the Levitation Charm!" to the console, indicating that the spell has been successfully cast on the object.

In the story, Harry uses this spell to make the Philosopher's Stone disappear from sight, thwarting Dracula's attempt to steal it. This showcases Harry's deep understanding of the magical world and his mastery of the spells necessary to protect it.

Overall, The Philosopher's Stone and the Dracula story teach us not only about bravery and friendship but also about the power of magic and the spells that can be used to defend against those who seek to do harm.
